Redmine Filler
=====

Are you tired of 'cornal' stuff on Redmine? Have you postponed all that working time and tasks into Redmine?

So this is for you!

Installation
-------------

::

    git clone git@github.com:gabriellima/redmine_filler.git

Observations
-------------

This is a first release, without placing things in their places.

So try to not judge this harshly, yet.

Also, for now, desconsider things at 'Pre-Setup' tutorial, because settings are all under `redmine.py`, instead of `settings.py`.

Pre-Setup
-------------

Edit file `settings.py` changing params

Running
-------------

::

    from redmine_filler.redmine import Redmine


External dependencies
---------------------

1. splinter::

    pip install splinter
